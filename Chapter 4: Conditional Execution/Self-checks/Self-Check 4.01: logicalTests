Translate each of the following English statements into logical tests that could be used in an if/else statement. 
Write the appropriate logical test for each statement below. Assume that three int variables, x, y, and z, have already been declared.

(Note: This problem is currently not very well implemented in Practice-It. 
Right now our system is just checking whether your answer exactly matches our expected answer, but some other correct answers might be 
marked as incorrect even though they would work. The answer in point i) in my case is marked by practice it as incorrect, and I've spent 
many hours digging in internet for working answer [so I could have all problems in chapter marked as solved] but most common answer was 
the same as mine.)

a. z is odd. 	
b. z is not greater than y's square root. 	
c. y is positive. 	
d. Either x or y is even, and the other is odd. (Hint: Don't use && or ||.) 	
e. y is a multiple of z. 	
f. z is not zero. 	
g. y is greater in magnitude than z. 	
h. x and z are of opposite signs. 	
i. y is a nonnegative one-digit number. 	
j. z is nonnegative. 	
k. x is even 	
l. x is closer in value to y than z is.

Answers:
a.  z % 2 == 1
b.  z <= Math.sqrt(y)
c.  y > 0
d.  x % 2 != y % 2
e.  y % z == 0
f.  z != 0
g.  Math.abs(y) > Math.abs(z)
h.  (x >= 0) == (z < 0)
i.  y == y % 10 
j.  z >= 0
k.  x % 2 == 0
l.  Math.abs(x - y) < Math.abs(z - y)
