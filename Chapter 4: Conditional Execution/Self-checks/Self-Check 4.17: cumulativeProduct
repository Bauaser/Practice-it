Write code to produce a cumulative product by multiplying together many numbers that are read from the console. 
Match the following format:

How many numbers? 4
Next number --> 7
Next number --> 2
Next number --> 3
Next number --> 15
Product = 630

Scanner console =new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("How many numbers? ");
int num = console.nextInt();
int n2=1;
for (int i=1; i<=num; i++) {
System.out.print("Next number --> ");
    int n1 = console.nextInt();
 n2= n1*n2;
}
System.out.println("Product = " +n2);
