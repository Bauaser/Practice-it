//Write a program called FarewellGoodBye that prints the following lyrics. Use static methods to show structure and eliminate redundancy in your solution.

//Farewell,
//goodbye,
//au revoir,
//good night!
//It's time, to go,
//and I'll be out of sight!

//Farewell,
//goodbye,
//au revoir,
//take care!
//I'll say, goodbye,
//that's neither here nor there!

//Farewell,
//goodbye,
//au revoir,
//see you later!
//I hope, you think,
//I'm a lover, not a hater!
