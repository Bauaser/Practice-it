The following program is legal under Java's syntax rules, but it is difficult to read because of its layout and lack of comments.
Reformat it using the rules given in Chapter 1, and add a comment header at the top of the program.
(Practice-It isn't really able to check that you satisfied the requirements of this question.
You will receive credit as long as you supply a reasonable amount of indentation and add two lines of // comments.)

public
class GiveAdvice{ public static
void main (String[ ]args){ System.out.println (

"Programs can be easy or");  System.out.println(
  "difficult to read, depending"
);  System.out.println("upon their format.")
          ;System.out.println();System.out.println(
"Everyone, including yourself,");
System.out.println
("will be happier if you choose");
        System.out.println("to format your programs."
);    }
   }

My answer:
//In all document sout stands for "System.out.println" or "System.out.print".
//I've added a lot of comments to show what was done whith original code.
//... Unfortunatly it resulted with another hard to read mess... 
//until you put it in some IDE

public class GiveAdvice{ 
    public static void main (String[]args){ 
    System.out.println ("Programs can be easy or"); //started sout command in new line.
// removed this empty line
  System.out.println( "difficult to read, depending"); // linked text with sout it belongs to, and write new sout in new line
  System.out.println("upon their format."); //started sout command in new line. 
  System.out.println(); //started sout command in new line.
  System.out.println("Everyone, including yourself,"); // linked with sout it belongs to
System.out.println("will be happier if you choose"); // linked with sout it belongs to
        System.out.println("to format your programs.");   
        } // moved ");" to the end of previous line
   }
