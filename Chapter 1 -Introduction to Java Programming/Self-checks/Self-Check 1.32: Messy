The following program is legal under Java's syntax rules, but it is difficult to read because of its layout and lack of comments. 
Reformat it using the rules given in Chapter 1, and add a comment header at the top of the program.
(Practice-It isn't really able to check that you satisfied the requirements of this question.
You will receive credit as long as you supply a reasonable amount of indentation and add two lines of // comments.)

public
class Messy{public
static void main(String[]args){message ()
  ;System.out.println() ; message ( );} public static void
message() { System.out.println(
    "I really wish that"
    );System.out.println
("I had formatted my source")
;System.out.println("code correctly!");}}

My answer:
//I've added a lot of comments to show what was done whith original code.
//... Unfortunatly it resulted with another hard to read mess... 
//until you put it in some IDE

public class Messy{ // Code reviewed with changes as follow - class header connected in single line. 
    public static void main(String[]args){ //method "main" header moved to one line
 message () ;
        System.out.println() ; 
        message ( ); // divided code into 3 different lines
    } 
    public static void message() { //method "message" header moved to single line.
        System.out.println("I really wish that");
        System.out.println("I had formatted my source");
        System.out.println("code correctly!"); //print commands reorganized that each of them is in separate line
    }
} // divided "}" into seperate lines
