These are self-checks from Practice-it University of Washington's introductory Java courses Chapter 6.

Those self-checks are mostly theoretical questions, or "correct code" problems.

Sometimes they require to write a few bare lines of code, but those are rare cases.

So in this folder you will NOT find code written by me.

That is also why all those are not saved as .java files.
