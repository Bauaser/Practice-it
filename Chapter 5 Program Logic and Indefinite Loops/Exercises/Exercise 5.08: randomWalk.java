//(This problem is a modified version of Chapter 5's randomWalk exercise from the textbook.)

//Write a method named randomWalk that performs a random one-dimensional walk, reporting each position reached and the maximum position reached during the walk. 
//The random walk should begin at position 0. On each step, you should either increase or decrease the position by 1 (with equal probability). 
//The walk stops when 3 or -3 is hit. The output should look like this:

//position = 0
//position = 1
//position = 0
//position = -1
//position = -2
//position = -1
//position = -2
//position = -3
//max position = 1
