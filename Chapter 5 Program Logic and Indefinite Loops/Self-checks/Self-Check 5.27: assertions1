For each of the five points labeled by comments, identify each of the assertions in the table below as either being always true, never true, 
or sometimes true / sometimes false. You may assume that no int values overflow their valid ranges.

public static int mystery(Scanner console, int x) {
    int y = console.nextInt();
    int count = 0;
    // Point A
    while (y < x) {
        // Point B
        if (y == 0) {
            count++;
            // Point C
        }
        y = console.nextInt();
        // Point D
    }
    // Point E
    return count;
}

Fill in each box of the the table below with ALWAYS, NEVER or SOMETIMES.

Point   	y < x 	      y == 0 	  count > 0
Point A 	SOMETIMES 	SOMETIMES 	NEVER
Point B   ALWAYS 	    SOMETIMES 	SOMETIMES
Point C 	ALWAYS      ALWAYS    	ALWAYS
Point D 	SOMETIMES 	SOMETIMES 	SOMETIMES
Point E 	NEVER 	    SOMETIMES 	SOMETIMES
