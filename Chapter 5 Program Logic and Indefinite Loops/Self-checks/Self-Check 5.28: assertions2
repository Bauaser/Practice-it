For each of the five points labeled by comments, identify each of the assertions in the table below as either being always true, never true, 
or sometimes true / sometimes false.

public static int mystery(int n) {
    Random r = new Random();
    int a = r.nextInt(3) + 1;
    int b = 2;
    // Point A
    while (n > b) {
        // Point B
        b = b + a;
        if (a > 1) {
            n--;
            // Point C
            a = r.nextInt(b) + 1;
        } else {
            a = b + 1;
            // Point D
        }
    }
    // Point E
    return n;
}
Fill in each box of the the table below with ALWAYS, NEVER or SOMETIMES.

Point     	n > b 	     a > 1 	    b > a
Point A 	SOMETIMES 	SOMETIMES 	SOMETIMES
Point B   ALWAYS    	SOMETIMES 	SOMETIMES
Point C 	SOMETIMES 	ALWAYS 	ALWAYS
Point D 	SOMETIMES 	ALWAYS 	NEVER
Point E 	NEVER 	    SOMETIMES 	SOMETIMES
