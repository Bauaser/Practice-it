Write a sentinel loop that repeatedly prompts the user to enter a number and, once the number -1 is typed, displays the maximum and minimum 
numbers that the user entered. Here is a sample dialogue:

Type a number (or -1 to stop): 5
Type a number (or -1 to stop): 2
Type a number (or -1 to stop): 17
Type a number (or -1 to stop): 8
Type a number (or -1 to stop): -1
Maximum was 17
Minimum was 2

int SENTINEL = -1;
System.out.print("Type a number (or " + SENTINEL + " to stop): ");
Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);
int num = console.nextInt();
int min = num;
int max = num;
while (num != SENTINEL) {
    if (num < min) {
        min = num;
    } else if (num > max) {
        max = num;
    }
    System.out.print("Type a number (or " + SENTINEL + " to stop): ");
    num = console.nextInt();
}
if (min != SENTINEL) {
    System.out.println("Maximum was " + max);
    System.out.println("Minimum was " + min);
}
