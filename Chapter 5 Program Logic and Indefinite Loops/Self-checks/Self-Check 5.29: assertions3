public static int mystery(Scanner console) {
    int prev = 0;
    int count = 0;
    int next = console.nextInt();
    // Point A
    while (next != 0) {
        // Point B
        if (next == prev) {
            // Point C
            count++;
        }
        prev = next;
        next = console.nextInt();
        // Point D
    }
    // Point E
    return count;
}
