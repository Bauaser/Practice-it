 Consider the following Draw7 program:

import java.awt.*;
public class Draw7 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DrawingPanel panel = new DrawingPanel(200, 200);
        Graphics g = panel.getGraphics();
        for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            g.drawOval(i * 10, i * 10, 200 - (i * 10), 200 - (i * 10));
        }
    }
}

What graphical output figure will be drawn by the Draw7 program? 

Answer:
The one in which circles get smaller as you are getting closer to lower right bottom.
