//Write a method called sphereVolume that accepts a radius (a real number) as a parameter and returns the volume of a sphere with that radius.
//For example, the call sphereVolume(2.0) should return 33.510321638291124. 
//The formula for the volume of a sphere with radius r is the following:

//volume = 4/3 π r^3

public static double sphereVolume (double r){
    double vol = Math.PI*Math.pow(r, 3)*4/3;
    return vol;
