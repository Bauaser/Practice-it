Write a method called min that takes three integers as parameters and returns the smallest of the three values, 
such that a call of min(3, -2, 7) would return -2, and a call of min(19, 27, 6) would return 6. 
Use Math.min to write your solution.

Answer:
public static int min (int x, int y, int z){
    int i = Math.min(x, Math.min( y, z));
return i;}
