Given the following program:
public class MysteryNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String one = "two";
        String two = "three";
        String three = "1";
        int number = 20;
        sentence(one, two, 3);
        sentence(two, three, 14);
        sentence(three, three, number + 1);
        sentence(three, two, 1);
        sentence("eight", three, number / 2);
    }
    public static void sentence(String three, String one, int number) {
        System.out.println(one + " times " + three + " = " + (number * 2));
    }
}
Write the output of each of the following calls.

a)  sentence(one, two, 3); 	
b)  sentence(two, three, 14); 	
c)  sentence(three, three, number + 1); 	
d)  sentence(three, two, 1); 	
e)  sentence("eight", three, number / 2);

Answers:
a)    three times two = 6
b)    1 times three = 28
c)    1 times 1 = 42
d)    three times 1 = 2
e)    1 times eight = 20
